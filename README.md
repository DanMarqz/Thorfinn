A web rendering engine written in the Rust language.

I'm writing this code purely for educational purposes. My goal is to create an
incomplete but extremely simple engine as a way to learn more about basic
implementation techniques, *without* worrying about complications like:

* <s>Real-world usability</s>
* <s>Standards compliance</s>
* <s>Performance and efficiency</s>
* <s>Interoperability</s>

Why create a simple—but useless—toy rendering engine? Mostly because I
personally want to learn how to do it.

For more details see [Let's build a browser engine!][blog], a series of
how-to articles based on this project.
